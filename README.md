# Big Island Christmas - Playlist Design Guidelines

## Mission Statement

The goal of this playlist is to serve as background music for a Hawaiian themed holiday celebration. The title of the playlist is *Big Island Christmas* (BIC). It is expected to be played on shuffle for ~12 hours over 2 days (Dec 24-25) for a group of 10, ages ranging 0-60's. 

## Guiding Principles

When compiling a large (100+ song count) playlist, there are many factors to consider in order to maximize enjoyment by the largest number of listeners. Broadly, the composition should follow a set of strict and semi-strict rubrics, collaboration guidelines should be shared with anyone interested in contributing, and a description of the build process.

*Note that any rule that describes guests includes playlist contributors.*

#### Composition Rubrics

The rubric speficiations are organized by how general they are, describing if is this a rule that applies to all large shufflable playlists or just this one, and how strict they are.

##### General

* Strict
  * The length in time should be at least 2x the number of hours of the event.
    * This allows for the event to run long without worry, for skipping trouble songs, etc.
  * Consider music tastes of guests, without focusing too much on one individual's.
    * If there are older folks in the crowd, skew the whole playlist toward oldies a little
      * Everyone can appreciate oldies; older folks have trouble appreciating new music
  * Subgenres should not range too far from the original thesis.
  * Avoid anything too mellow (unless the theme is mellow music)
    * Not all good songs are good for a party. 
  * No songs over 6 minutes long.
    * Nothing works for everbody, and 6 minutes is too long if it's not for you.
* Semi-Strict
  * Do not take requests or make any changes on the day of.
    * It's a slippery slope. This is not a DJ service, it's a curated playlist experience.
  * Don't let a single artist take up more than 5% of the playlist
  * Any song over 5 minutes long had better be amazing or it gets cut.
  * Rough target composition %
    * Macro
      * 75% upbeat
      * 25% more chill
    * Micro
      * 60% Earnest, on-theme vocal
      * 30% Earnest, on-theme instrumental
      * 05% Funny/Gimmick Songs

##### BIC Specific

* Strict
  * Avoid songs with heavily offensive lyrics.
    * There are small kids here.
* Semi-Strict
  * Holiday music sub-genre selection should be scoped to these, in order of preference:
    * Worldwide (Hawaiian)
    * Surf Rock 
    * Instrumental
      * Ukulele
      * Steel Drum
    * Exotica
    * "Tropical"
      * Caribbean
      * Reggae
  * Keep Christ out of X-Mas.
    * Songs about Jesus are nearly universally slow and boring. Not great party fare.
      * One exception would be Boney M's X-Mas song, but it doesn't fit the Hawaii theme.
  * Prefer Hawaiian artists where possible, but pay attention to other guidelines.
    * Many, many Hawaiian artists with Holiday albums don't capture the "sound of Hawaii."


#### Collaboration Guidelines

It can be a challenge to adhere to the design principles of this playlist style when collaborating with others. However it is incredibly rewarding to include others, as music is a shared experience. It's important that individuals who would like to contribute be heard. The following checklist is helpful for folks recommending songs to follow:

* Review the design guidelines; only submit songs that fit all criteria
* The deadline for submissions should be respected
* Review the current playlist draft to get a sense of fitness when considering new songs
* Don't share the playlist draft widely, as folks at the event should be hearing it fresh.
* Songs should be submitted in bulk in a shared playlist
* If a song you add isn't played, it likely either:
  * Didn't get picked up by shuffle
  * Meet the other established criteria


#### Build Process

- [x] Name the playlist
- [x] Add candidates that obviously fit the theme
- [x] Search for lists of similar candidates and add those that seem like a fit:
  - [x] Official streaming service offerings
  - [x] Community shared playlists
  - [ ] Music blog entries
- [x] Listen for 4+ hours to evaluate for fitness
- [ ] Remove songs/artists/albums as appropriate
- [ ] Repeat all steps above as needed
- [ ] Incorporate recommendations
- [ ] Deduplicate
- [ ] Finalize
  - [ ] Create a pre-shuffled version in case shuffle mode is not selected
  - [ ] Port to streaming services used by all event guests
- [ ] After Event: Share links
